Windows Server 2012 R2 Hardening Guide
Created by Tanner Michael
--------------------------------------------
This guide is for anyone looking to harden their Windows Server machines.
--------------------------------------------

Lets get started!

Installs of Windows Server might better suit you if you do a custom install and only download the required componenets. 

Always keep the admin account secure. Most brute force attacks are directed at this account as it has the most priveledges. 
The best way to keep your admin account secure is to rename the 'Administrator' username to something else. 

Setup User account policies. If multiple users access your server, then set up User Account policies. 
- Don't allow empty passwords
- Enforce minimum password length and complexity
- Use a lockout policy
- Don't store passwords using reversible encryption
- Enable 2FA

Employing the Principle of "Least Priviledge" is huge. 
- Avoid potential security issues due to mishandling of access rights.
- Provide the minimum rights each user needs to carry out his/her duties.
- Set up a Group Policy or use Role Base Access Control (RBAC) component to specify access restrictions according to your own requirements. 

Disable unnecessary network ports and services.
- Only enable the network ports used by the OS and installed components
- Disable/close the remaining ports
- Run a port scan of the system to confirm all nonfunctional ports are properly protected
- Disable all unused network services (Bluetooth, wifi, etc) to prevent unathorized access

General Security Settings
- Disable unneeded services
- Remove unneeded Windows componenets
- Do not use AUTORUN. Untrusted code can be run without the direct knowledge of the user
- Require Ctrl + Alt + Del for interactice logins
- Configure a machine inactivity limit to protect idle interactive sessions



This next section is a little more nitty-gritty and will be more detailed than the basic stuff above. Have fun!

Organizational Security 
Maintain an inventory record for each server that clearly documents its baseline configuration and records each change to the server.
Test and validate every proposed change to server hardware or software before moving to a production environment. 
Regularly perform risk assessments and fix all issues in a timely manner. 

User Account Security Hardening 
Ensure all passwords meet password best practice guidelines. 
Disallow users from creating and logging in with Microsoft accounts
Disable the guest account. 
Do not allow "everyone" permissions to apply anonymous users.
Promptly disable or delete unusued user accounts. 

Network Security Configuration 
Enable the Windows Firewall in all profiles (domain, private, public) and configure it to block inbound traffic by default
Perform port blocking at the network setting level. Determine which ports need to be open and restrict access to all other ports. 
Restrict the ability to access each computer from the network to Authenticated Users only. 
Do not grant any users the 'act as part of the operating system' right.
Deny gues account the ability to log on as a service, a batch job, locally or via RDP
RDP is utilized, set the RDP connection encryption level to high.
Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP
